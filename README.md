### Maeda's 8th clock revised

This is a clock based on Maeda's 8th clock design. Originally I started to re-create Maeda's design with the minute and hour numbers changing sizes in time with the seconds, however I decided to modify this concept slightly to create a much longer loop of sizes and include more detailed times.
