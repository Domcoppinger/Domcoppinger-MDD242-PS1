### Maeda's 8th clock revised and modernised

This is a clock based on Maeda's 8th clock design. 

Originally I started to re-create Maeda's design with my own rather different twist on it. However I later decided to create an iteration which was much closer to the original. This version uses unpixelated numbers to create less of a 'retro' design and the alternating changing of the size and shade of the hour and minute numbers is tied to the passage of each second so as to represent the passage of all three of the primary units of time.
