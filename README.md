### Final clock

The result of many iterations of work this is an clock with a focus on simplicity and longevity. It uses a fairly standard text display for the time however these numbers scale the closer they get to the end of their time unit (second, minute, hour, or day). The background color changes to represent the time of day. The three circles also change shade relative to their distance to the end of their greater time unit (month, year, century). There is also two possible alarm countdowns and warnings which are picked at random. The base code has also been modified to allow the new time units and to debug them.
